  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

  * What new skills have you learned?
  I didn’t really learn any new skills. But it was fun writing some HTML. I learned it, back in 1997! And never used it again.
  I am getting more familiar with Atom Editor (The HTML code completion is not the best).

  * What has been easy?
  I was pretty easy overall.

  * What has been difficult?
  I had to lookup the subscript and superscript tags as I couldn’t remember.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  I used the following strategies:
  - I broke down the project in small steps (e.g working one paragraph at a time)
  - Some trial an error and verifying the output on the browser as I made my changes.
