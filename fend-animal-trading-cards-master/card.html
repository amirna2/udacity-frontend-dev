			<p class="text-padding top-fact ">Chameleons have a third eye in the center of their foreheads. It is a rudimentary eye
that is essentially a spot of pigment connected to the pineal gland by a nerve. It helps
in determining light from darkness, and is able to detect varying levels of ultraviolet
light.</p>

			<p class="text-padding">Large bodied lizard with long tail. Large, conical eyes with fused
eyelids. Oustaletâ€™s chameleons can be distinguished from other chameleons by the
ridges and plates on their head. They have ridges from the tip of the snout to both eyes,
and a smaller ridge from the eye to the back of the neck. They have a large plate on top
of their heads that curves to a point towards the back of the skull. They also have a ridge
of triangular spines along the top of their back from the neck to the tail.
Coloration is variable and ranges from brown to green to blue. </p>
